Die With A Smile
by Bruno Mars ft. Lady Gaga

Ooh, ooh
Nobody's gonna hurt you, baby
Nobody's gonna dare to try
You want a reason to keep believin'
I can give you that tonight

I will die with a smile
If the last thing I do is get you home tonight
I will die with a smile on my face
If you say, "Everything will be alright"

'Cause nobody's gonna hurt you, baby
Nobody's gonna dare to try
You want a reason to keep believin'
I can give you that tonight

I will die with a smile
If the last thing I do is get you home tonight
I will die with a smile on my face
If you say, "Everything will be alright"

Nobody's gonna hurt you, baby
Nobody's gonna dare to try
You want a reason to keep believin'
I can give you that tonight

I will die with a smile
If the last thing I do is get you home tonight
I will die with a smile on my face
If you say, "Everything will be alright"

Die with a smile, die with a smile
Die with a smile, die with a smile
I will die with a smile
